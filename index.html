				<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
				<p>Koi fish have intrigued and inspired for centuries. They have been called “living jewels” and “swimming flowers” for their physical beauty. They are also rich with symbolic significance, especially in Asian cultures.</p>
				<p>They’re adorned with bright colors that can include yellow, orange, gold, white, black, silver and a calico mix. In Japanese and other Asian cultures, the koi fish is a celebrated creature, embodying many noble qualities and ideals.</p>

				<h3>Dragon's Gate </h3>
				<p>According to Chinese legend, there was a place called Dragon's Gate at the top 
					of a large waterfall on Yellow River. Carp would swim up the river, against 
					the current to reach the base of the waterfall. 
					Although many would try, only a few were brave and able enough 
					to attempt the final leap up the waterfall. It was said that if 
					a carp was able to complete the journey through Dragon's Gate 
					at the top of the falls, then it would be transformed into a 
					powerful dragon. In Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol 
					of great power. The story symbolizes that anybody who is 
					able to persevere through great trials can accomplish their 
					highest goals to become great.</p>

				<h3>Symbolism</h3>
				<p>Koi Fish meaning in Japan is good fortune or luck they also are associated with perseverance in adversity and strength of purpose, the Koi fish symbolize good luck, abundance and perseverance. Symbolic in Buddhism is to represent courage. Today the fish are considered to be symbolic of advancement materially and spiritually.</p>
				<p>Another legend states that the koi climb the waterfall bravely, and if they are caught, they face their death on the cutting board bravely like a samuri. In Japan, the word koi refers primarily to the wild variety. As a result, many of the country’s symbolic meanings for the fish refer to the wild variety instead of the fish species as a whole. One of the primary reasons the fish is symbolic in Japanese culture is because it is known for swimming upstream no matter what the conditions are. These fish are even said to swim up waterfalls. This is viewed as an absolute show of power because they will continue to swim upstream as if on a mission. </p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p>The fish is symbolically employed as the emblem of wealth or abundance, 
					on account of the similarity in the pronunciation of the words fish, 
					and superfluity, and also because fish are extremely plentiful in Chinese 
					waters. Owing to its reproductive powers it is a symbol of regeneration, 
					and, as it is happy in its own element or sphere, so it has come to be the 
					mblem of harmony and connubial bliss. As fish are reputed to swim in pairs, 
					so a pair of fish is emblematic of the joys of union, especially of a sexual 
					nature; it is also one of the charms to avert evil, and is included among the 
					auspicious signs on the Footprints of Buddha. "The fish signifies freedom from 
					all restraint. As in the water a fish moves easily in any direction, so in the 
					Buddha-state the fully-emancipated knows no restraints or obstruction."</p>
				<p>There are many Koi Breeds or Koi Varieties. Each Koi is a unique fish in that no two are alike. Within this uniqueness there is an order of things, so that Koi can be divided into broad categories based on their markings and colors. In Japan there are 13 basic lineages recognized and these are accepted throughout the world. Within these groups there are numerous other divisions which relate to the way in which the colors, scales or combination of these are formed in the individual fish.</p>
				<p>Unique Koi breeds can be described in many ways and each way is no less correct than any other, it being purely one’s opinion on the features of the Koi. In other cases a precise name can be applied without any problem. Where the Japanese do not have a single word to describe a combination of features, they simply add one term to another. When these terms are used in the West they may be reduced somewhat so that Utsurimono will normally be called Utsuri.</p>
